# PS-ODBC-Connection-Creator

Hello! 
This is my first ever Powershell script with a GUI, I hope you like it.
It's a PowerShell APP (With GUI) for users to easily add ODBC connections themselves from a list. 

- The app already works as it is, however if you download the script for your own use, you will need to change some of the tags (i.e. "ODBC Connection 1" and "SERVERNAME" to the settings that match your setup.

- The way I turn this into an easy app for users to run is to create a shortcut to it, then open the properties of the shortcut and set the Target field to to C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0\powershell.exe -NoProfile -WindowStyle Hidden -file "SCRIPT FILE PATH\Add an ODBC Connection GUI.ps1" and change the Start in field to C:\Windows\System32\WindowsPowerShell\v1.0 *if this is a file I will get a user to browse to and run themselves, I typically store it with the script file and hide the script*

Thanks for looking at my script :)
